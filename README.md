How this book is organized:
This book helps you understand data and how to manage data in the following steps:
- explain what data is
- show you the conceptual model of data
- how to capture data in database management system (DBMS)
- how to retrieve data
- how to look for a particular piece of data in DBMS

This book covers these steps in 3 rounds, starting with simplest concepts and introducing more complexities by adding more requirements that real-life business applications would require.
However, in each round, we will always go through all these steps so that you would start with some new concepts and end with practical skills of using the DBMS to make use of the new concepts. 

This book tries to relate to real-world and common problems to help you see these problems from the perspective of an IT person where you need to be able to understand both the real world and the machine.
DBMS can be considered as representing a small part of the world. This is similar to how a camera can take an image of a portion of the world. As human, we can look at the photo and make sense of it easily.
